# Godzig's Foundry VTT Macros

Playing around with foundry macros.

## Release Process

Releases are automatically created.  To simplify the process, modify
your git config via:

```
git config pull.rebase true

```

## Script Entry Overrides

Default database tags may be overridden with colon-separated key-value pairs
at the beginning of the script.  See `scripts/Twilight_Sanctuary.js` for an
example of this functionality.
